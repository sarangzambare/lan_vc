# Simple application for LAN VideoChat using TCP sockets.
## Author: Sarang Zambare

The aim of making this program is educational. At the Indian Institute of Technology,Bombay, IP addresses
are distributed according to room numbers. This fact can be exploited into making a program where-in the the student can enter
the room number of his/her friend and start a video chat. 

Though this sounds straightforward, in reality its not possible if the reciever has his/her firewall turned on. :(


The main aim of this project was to learn about the TCP and UDP protocols, and implementing the socket class in Java, also explore ways of converting video frame data into string/bytes and to transfer the same over
TCP and UDP protocols.

UDP turned out to give a much more smooth video frame-rate (yet nowhere close to what skype offers, obviously).

### Update: I have stopped working on this repository.
